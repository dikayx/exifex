## Opening an issue

If you encounter a bug, have a feature request, or want to suggest an improvement, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dikayx/exifex/issues). Make sure to include as much information as possible, such as:

-   A clear and descriptive title
-   A detailed description of the issue or feature request
-   Steps to reproduce the bug (_if applicable_)
-   Expected behavior and actual behavior
-   Screenshots or error messages (_if applicable_)

## Pull requests

If you want to contribute code to the project, you can open a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dikayx/exifex/pulls).

## Coding style

Please try follow the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) coding style guide when contributing to the project. You can use tools like [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) to check your code for PEP 8 compliance.

However, don't worry too much about the coding style if you're new to Python or Flask. Try to match the existing style in the project and I'll help you with the rest.

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request, make sure to test your changes locally. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This will run the test suite and check for any errors or failures. If everything passes, you're good to go!

## Documentation

If you're adding a new feature or making significant changes to the project, please update the documentation accordingly. This includes the README, installation guide, and any other relevant files.
